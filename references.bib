The coding standard details a set of guiding principles (more below) as well as specific naming conventions and other rules for the use of data types, functions, preprocessor macros, variables and much more. Individual rules that have been demonstrated to reduce or eliminate certain types of bugs are highlighted.},

@article{a_energy_efficien_smart_led_systems,
abstract = {Recent studies have shown that energy-efficient smart LED lighting systems provide a better visual comfort-working environment at a reduced energy consumption compared to existing lighting systems. Present daylighting systems are able to regulate the light intensities via communication technologies utilizing smart sensors. This paper presents implementation of a smart LED lighting system utilizing different energy-efficient techniques without compromising the visual comfort of occupants. The proposed lighting system uses ZigBee and Wi-Fi communication protocols to control the lights of commercial/residential buildings according to natural daylight, occupancy or as per the requirements of the inhabitants of the building. The lighting system can be operated in three different modes: Manual, Auto, and Hybrid to account for various applications. A wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) is used to collect available data, regarding the usage of personalised smart LED lights by occupants in the building. A complete design and implementation of the smart lighting system are presented in the paper. The paper also presents the detailed test-bed implementation of the proposed smart lighting technique and data management system to illustrate the impact of the proposed lighting system on energy consumption and occupants' visual satisfaction. The proposed lighting system aims to reduce energy consumption by 60-70{\%} compared to the existing lighting system while satisfying the visual comfort of the occupants. The proposed work also suggests the guidelines to incorporate intelligence into the system such that it can automatically predict the occupant preferences in a decentralized framework for better visual comfort and improved energy utilization in existing buildings.},

@book{b_programming_embedded_systems,
abstract = {If you have programming experience and a familiarity with C--the dominant language in embedded systems--Programming Embedded Systems, Second Edition is exactly what you need to get started with embedded software. This software is ubiquitous, hidden away inside our watches, DVD players, mobile phones, anti-lock brakes, and even a few toasters. The military uses embedded software to guide missiles, detect enemy aircraft, and pilot UAVs. Communication satellites, deep-space probes, and many medical instruments would have been nearly impossible to create without embedded software. The first edition of Programming Embedded Systems taught the subject to tens of thousands of people around the world and is now considered the bible of embedded programming. This second edition has been updated to cover all the latest hardware designs and development methodologies. The techniques and code examples presented here are directly applicable to real-world embedded software projects of all sorts. Examples use the free GNU software programming tools, the eCos and Linux operating systems, and a low-cost hardware platform specially developed for this book. If you obtain these tools along with Programming Embedded Systems, Second Edition, you'll have a full environment for exploring embedded systems in depth. But even if you work with different hardware and software, the principles covered in this book apply. Whether you are new to embedded systems or have done embedded work before, you'll benefit from the topics in this book, which include:How building and loading programs differ from desktop or server computers Basic debugging techniques--a critical skill when working with minimally endowed embedded systems Handling different types of memory Interrupts, and the monitoring and control of on-chip and external peripherals Determining whether you have real-time requirements, and whether your operating system and application can meet those requirements Task synchronization with real-time operating systems and embedded Linux Optimizing embedded software for size, speed, and power consumption Working examples for eCos and embedded Linux So whether you're writing your first embedded program, designing the latest generation of hand-held whatchamacalits, or managing the people who do, this book is for you. Programming Embedded Systems will help you develop the knowledge and skills you need to achieve proficiency with embedded software. Praise for the first edition: "This lively and readable book is the perfect introduction for those venturing into embedded systems software development for the first time. It provides in one place all the important topics necessary to orient programmers to the embedded development process. --Lindsey Vereen, Editor-in-Chief, Embedded Systems Programming},

@article{a_iot,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that combines aspects and technologies coming from different approaches. Ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, Internet Protocol, sensing technologies, communication technologies, and embedded devices are merged together in order to form a system where the real and digital worlds meet and are continuously in symbiotic interaction. The smart object is the building block of the IoT vision. By putting intelligence into everyday objects, they are turned into smart objects able not only to collect information from the environment and interact/control the physical world, but also to be interconnected, to each other, through Internet to exchange data and information. The expected huge number of interconnected devices and the significant amount of available data open new opportunities to create services that will bring tangible benefits to the society, environment, economy and individual citizens. In this paper we present the key features and the driver technologies of IoT. In addition to identifying the application scenarios and the correspondent potential applications, we focus on research challenges and open issues to be faced for the IoT realization in the real world.},
